Create the workspace and package 
1-create Workspac and package using this command 
-->mkdir ros2_ws/src
2-Build colcon in the workspace ros2_ws as --> colcon build
3-add the workspcae to the .bashrc file as --> gedit ~/.bashrc
in the src folder after colcon build there are four files  """ build  install  log  src """ created
4-create package as --> ros2 pkg create <name_of_the_package> 
(As in my case it is as -->ros2 pkg create my_robot_description )
5-in the my_robot_description package these folder and files will be created """ CMakeLists.txt  include  package.xml  src """ 
fro these just remove folders. as in here these are "include" and "src" as -->rm -rf include/ src/
6-Tehn create "urdf" named folder in the same directory (my_robot_description) as --> mkdir urdf
7-make the urdf in this folder or copy here urdf files.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////
run the urdf file without using urdf_tutorial package (First go to th urdf folder in terminal and then run this command) go to workspace and run "colcon build" and "source install/setup.bash"and then:
Command1 run the robot model:  ros2 run robot_state_publisher robot_state_publisher --ros-args -p robot_description:="$(xacro robot.urdf )"

check the nodes if the robot_description is running or not:  ros2 node list

run the command to see the joints GUI to toogle it and intrect with robot: ros2 run joint_state_publisher_gui joint_state_publisher_gui

can verfiy the node by seeing on the rqt graph command: rqt

now launch the rviz to load the rbot in the rviz to intract with it: ros2 run rviz2 rviz2

Next: 
1-now set the fram fram mape to robot's base link 
2-using the add button add the "Robot_Model" and "TF" elements
3-In the TF you can see the robot transformation arrangement
4-In the Robot_Model go to the option of Description_Topic and select the robot_description option from description options

Now we can run the robot in its workspace directory using this command: ros2 launch my_robot_description display.launch.xml



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
display.launch.xml file code 
<launch>
    <!-- path to the URDF file (use the package share directory) -->
    <arg name="urdf_path" default="$(find-pkg-share my_robot_description)/urdf/my_robot.urdf"/>

    <!-- publish robot state using robot_state_publisher (robot_description param generated by xacro) -->
    <node pkg="robot_state_publisher" exec="robot_state_publisher" name="robot_state_publisher" output="screen">
        <param name="robot_description" command="$(command xacro $(arg urdf_path))"/>
    </node>

    <!-- joint state publisher GUI -->
    <node pkg="joint_state_publisher_gui" exec="joint_state_publisher_gui" name="joint_state_publisher_gui" output="screen"/>

    <!-- RViz2 -->
    <node pkg="rviz2" exec="rviz2" name="rviz2" output="screen"/>

</launch>



///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
to run the gazebo there are some steps as simple comand told in the video is not working correctly standalone(Note: after using the below process this command works fine) so (video command ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py)
--> run this:  gzserver --verbose -s libgazebo_ros_factory.so
# and then just for the GUI "gzclient"
--> and then "ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py"

then spawn the robot entity in the gazebo enviroment
--> ros2 run gazebo_ros spawn_entity.py -topic robot_description -entity <Name_of_urdf_file_without_it's_extension>
like in my case it is as "ros2 run gazebo_ros spawn_entity.py -topic robot_description -entity my_robot"


To run the whole project run this command
--> ros2 launch <robot package name here> <launch file name here> 
AS in my case it is (ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_gazebo.launch.xml)

to move the robot on the predefined motion inputs we can give this command by changing the parameters to get required motion (like below the rbot move in inear x axis with 0.5 m/s velocity)
-->ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.5, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}"


if you wnat to move the robot using keybord keys use this command 
-->ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r /cmd_vel:=/cmd_vel


if you want to get pdf of the tree of the links and joints hirerachy
--> ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames -o arm_frames






To move the robot joints to the desired positions, use joint controllers (for robotics arm here) 
-->ros2 topic pub -1 /set_joint_trajectory trajectory_msgs/msg/JointTrajectory '{header: {frame_id: arm_base_link}, joint_names: [base_forearm_joint, forearm_hand_joint], points: [ {positions: {0.2, 0.9}} ]}'


To remove the folder from the git 
--> rm -rf ~/Robotics/ros2_ws/.git
To copy the folder to another location
-->cp -r ~/ros2_ws ~/Robotics/



to update the changes in the github
cd ~/Robotics
git add .  (or with folder name as->) git add ros2_ws
git commit -m "Add ros2_ws workspace"
git push
